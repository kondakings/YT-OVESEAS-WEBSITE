    <div class="content-container">
        <p>
            Analysis of the student profile is a vital part of the free career counselling process at YT Overseas.
            In this stage, the counsellor assesses the student’s strengths, weaknesses, interests, and personality traits to form a comprehensive profile.
            The evaluation is based on academic performance, extracurricular activities, work or volunteer experience, and other criteria.
            The profile analysis helps the counsellor to determine the student’s aptitude for a particular field of study. This aptitude assessment is critical since it helps the student to understand their strengths and interests.
            Based on the student’s profile, the career counsellor can recommend courses that align with the student’s interests, career goals, and skill set.

            The counsellor provides information on the courses’ duration, fees, curriculum, and career opportunities.
            The counsellor also guides the student on the best institutions in that particular course.
            The counsellor provides options from various countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and other countries.
            Specifically, the counsellor ensures that the course options presented to the student align with their desired destination.
