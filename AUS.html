        <div class="content-container">
            <p>While Australia has a reputation for being relatively expensive, the cost of education and living expenses can vary based on your location and chosen institution.

        <div class="content-container">
            <p>
                Australia prioritizes the well-being of its international students by providing access to a world-class healthcare system. The Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) ensures that students have affordable medical care, giving them peace of mind and allowing them to focus on their studies without concerns about healthcare expenses.

        <h2>Post-Study Work Opportunities</h2>
        <div class="content-container">
            <p>
                Upon completing their study in Australia, international students in Australia have the opportunity to gain practical experience through the post-study work opportunities. The Temporary Graduate visa (subclass 485) allows graduates to work in Australia, providing valuable exposure to the local job market and enhancing their employability on a global scale.
