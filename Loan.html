        <h2 class="uk-benefit">Types of Loans</h2>
        <div class="uk-benefit-container">
            <div class="text-content">
            <p>
                YT Overseas offers support for both secured and unsecured education loans, customizing its approach based on each student's financial situation and preferences.
            </p>
        <h3>Secured Loans</h3>
        <p>
        These loans require collateral, such as property, fixed deposits, or other valuable assets. Since the lender's risk is lower, secured loans usually come with lower interest rates. YT Overseas assists students in securing these loans, helping them use their assets to get favorable financial terms.
        </p> 
        <h3>Unsecured Loans</h3>
        <p>
        Unsecured loans don't require any collateral but often have higher interest rates. YT Overseas guides students through the application process for unsecured loans, ensuring they understand the terms and conditions of these financing options.

    <h2>Loan disbursement</h2>
    <div class="content-container">
        <p>
            Securing an education loan is just the first step; getting the funds disbursed is just as important.
            YT Overseas offers complete support to ensure that the loan amount is released on time and without issues. This includes working closely with financial institutions,
            checking all required documents, and making sure the funds are used for their intended purposes, like tuition, housing, and other study-related expenses.
            YT Overseas acts as a link between students and banks, making the disbursement process smooth and reducing any potential problems. This careful approach helps students have a worry-free experience as they get ready to study abroad.
